									<h1>Overview of<br />
									my Portfolio</h1>
									<p>This is a brief introduction and overview of the content, details, purpose, meaning, and personal significance of my portfolio. </p>

								<p><strong>	A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF MY PORTFOLIO</strong></p>
								<p>My projects vary in complexity, practicality, and purpose. Some are fun explorations of long-standing interests: I designed an astronomical clock to pursue a fascination with clockwork and astronomy; I built a unique table to challenge myself and experiment with ideas. Other projects are practical consumer-based products: I designed a geometric pop-up tent to address my boy scout troop’s frustrations; I co-developed an automated hydroponic garden when I couldn’t find cheap, space-efficient, low-maintenance products online. Some projects have been a mix of both: I developed an Ornithopter to pursue my interests in bird flight, with the goal of creating a functional technologically-advanced version of an ancient idea. All these projects are unified under a shared eagerness to creatively rethink preexisting ideas and products.</p>
								<p><strong>	HOW I MAKE</strong></p>
								<p>I design and simulate on Fusion 360, and use Arduino for electronics. For manufacturing, I use 3D printers and laser cutters. I also use a wide range of conventional prototyping tools. When I need help programming, I access Arduino online support and my school’s CS teacher. Similarly, I use Autodesk online support and All3DP for CAD and printing advice. As for inspiration, I use walks outside, youtube, Nature magazines, and my cherished collection of DaVinci drawings. I’ve also contacted a GE Engineer to discuss complicated mechanical issues and emailed company specialists for suggestions on laser-cutting fiberglass. I’ve repurposed a corner of my room into a workspace, using a salvaged workbench and shelving. I also work in my school’s engineering room, on my computer, and in a notebook I carry around with me.</p>
								<p><strong>	WHY I MAKE</strong></p>
								<p>I've been inventing for as long as I remember, voraciously pursuing an insatiable curiosity, appetite for challenges, and expansive creativity. I explore my diverse curiosities through projects. For example, ideas for an astronomical clock and an ornithopter stemmed from my interests in clockwork, DaVinci, birds, and biomimicry. I also enjoy gaining skills and knowledge through my projects. From CAD simulation techniques to aerodynamics and plant biology, learning is a rewarding way to spend my free time. I enjoy challenging the limits of my creativity and perseverance. By providing direction and goals, challenges make my life exciting. The intense concentration of building a project and the thrill when a solution works are intoxicating. It's hard to imagine my life without engineering endeavors filling the gaps. I build to relax, disconnect, learn, and have fun.</p>
								<p><strong>	MY MOST MEANINGFUL PROJECT</strong></p>
								<p>Over the past 2 years, developing an original ornithopter has become part of my everyday life. Through 300 hours of countless challenges, I’ve learned the value of failure. Here are a few examples: While designing the flapping mechanism, I tried to produce solutions mathematically. When this proved unrealistic, I resorted to iterative simulations in Fusion 360, gaining persistence and creativity. When the 3D printer I was using broke, I studied mechatronics and then successfully rewired and rebuilt the printer. This several-week challenge taught me dedication and rewarded my curiosity. When the gearbox jammed, I learned by seeking help from mechanical engineers. I also took an online mechanical design course and eventually solved the problem. This ambitious project has been the culmination of my engineering passions, a test of perseverance, and an immense learning experience.</p>
